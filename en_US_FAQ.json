Just navigate to the Custom Serverlist, select an unsupported server, press \"Custom Pack\" and select a Server Pack. <br> During this procedure, our system does some background checks whether the pack is encrypted or not. If it is encrypted, a subpack will be created automatically. <br> <br> A Server Pack is a resource pack from the server. DO NOT INTERCHANGE with a normal TexturePack!!! <br> <br> Ask your favorite server server to share their Server Pack with you!"

The end device and the system, the server is running on, must be in the same network. <br><br>➡️ 2. Removing restrictions, locks or limitations from the network router settings. <br><br>➡️ 3.
